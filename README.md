# Crud-Books
### Crud book review project. Implemented with Angular (front-end) and Spring Boot (back-end). I used these two technologies to develop a full-stack application and improve my web development skills.

## Let's start with the frontend

###  I used the Angular Framework to build the front-end for a few reasons, the first was the use of NgForm which is an Angular directive that makes life a lot easier when it comes to working with forms. In this case I used forms both when creating a review and when updating a review. Another reason was to be able to use Angular Material, which implements several features in the front-end such as Snack-Bar, Forms with easy styling, expandable panels, among other features. I also took advantage of several modules provided by Angular such as: Router Module, Forms Module, Http Module, among others.
