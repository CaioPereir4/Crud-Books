# Crud-Books
### Crud book review project. Implemented with Angular (front-end) and Spring Boot (back-end). I used these two technologies to develop a full-stack application and improve my web development skills.

# Let's start with the frontend

### I used the Angular Framework to build the front-end for a few reasons, the first was the use of NgForm which is an Angular directive that makes life a lot easier when it comes to working with forms. In this case I used forms both when creating a review and when updating a review. Another reason was to be able to use Angular Material, which implements several features in the front-end such as Snack-Bar, Forms with easy styling, expandable panels, among other features. I also took advantage of several modules provided by Angular such as: Router Module, Forms Module, Http Module, among others.

# Now let's talk about the backend

### On the backend I opted to work with the Spring Framework using Spring boot to build a Rest API. Spring is a modular framework, so when we use it we have to add modules according to our needs. Modules used: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Validation and Lombok. You can read and understand more at: https://spring.io/projects . The database used was PostgreSQL, that's why we added the PostgreSQL Driver module to Spring Boot, when running this project you need to configure the connection to the database and this is possible in the file: application.properties . Within the project, the architecture of Java was based on MVC standards, through the construction of Models, Services, Repositories and Controllers.
